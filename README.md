Manfighter
==========

A turn-based fighting game in Java, with a wide variety of weapons and abilities.

To play, compile everything and run Manfighter. The project was created in Eclipse, so you may drag the folders into an Eclipse project to have it do the work for you.

The wiki (above) has some general game information, and the dev log, with more detailed patch notes, runs at http://manfighter.wordpress.com/
